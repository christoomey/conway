# Conway

Conway is a simple javascript implimentation of [Conway's Game of
Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). It is written in
coffesscript as an initial experiment with the language.

Potential inspiration would be [this
site](http://www.chaos.org.uk/~eddy/craft/weblife.html) which has an amazingly
detailed analysis of Life.
